hey Alex,

see if you can't get the green dot into the game
and have it move on its own.

Here's a link to the pygame docs: https://www.pygame.org/docs/

also, after downloading python and pygame, run the game with `python3 ./game.py`

Also make the dot orange and finish this spooky game by halloween.
